Creating a comparator library that can be used to compare 2 API responses (HTTP/HTTPS)

The input to code should be two files with millions of request URLs.
Sample content for files:
Each file contains (HTTP/HTTPS) API's separated by a new line.

File1                                                 File2
https://reqres.in/api/users/3                       https://reqres.in/api/users/2
https://reqres.in/api/users/1                       https://reqres.in/api/users?page=3
https://reqres.in/api/users/2                       /api/unknown/2
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2                  https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1                  … and so on
…. And so on.

Your code should read the (HTTP/HTTPS) requests from File 1 and File 2, use any http client library, and
compare the response of
File 1 : line 1 & File 2 : line 1,
File 1 : line 2 & File 2 : line 2,
File 1 : line 3 & File 2 : line 3,
....and so on

Must have
● Your compare function should be able to compare two JSON responses. [Avoid using a third party
library or dependency for comparing JSONs]
● Assume that your code should be capable of comparing millions of API requests without any
memory issues. [Mandatory: Test with at least 1000 requests]
● Handle exceptions gracefully (don't terminate the program in case of exceptions)
● Print the output when responses are compared in the below format.

https://reqres.in/api/users/3 not equals https://reqres.in/api/users/1
https://reqres.in/api/users/2 equals https://reqres.in/api/users/2
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 equals https://reqres.in/api/users?page= 1
